* Download the zipfile containing the symbology files.
* Extract the zip archive and move the svg directory to a place where you want to store the patterns and symbols. It can be any directory.

* Under the SVG Paths form click the add button and select the directory where you moved the svg directory
* In QGis, go to 'Settings -> Style Manager' and click on 'Import/Export -> Import items' button (at bottom-left)
* Select the geologic_symblib.xml file you have found in the zip file
You should now have the geologic symbols working in your QGis!
