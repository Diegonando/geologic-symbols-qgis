 Introduction
************************

Geologic mapping is an interpretative process which usually is finalized in the production of a geologic map, where a wide range of symbols are used to visually encode the information over the map sheet.

Symbology is divided into three main categories:

* line symbols: describing linear geologic feature, from geologic contact to faults and lineations
* point symbols: describing point measurements (strike, dip) or describing features too small to be mapped differently
* area patterns: differentiating one terrain/material/unit from another
